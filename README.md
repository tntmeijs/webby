# Webby
Webby is a simple Rust web server that supports HTTP 1.1.
The main goal of this project is to provide a very simple web server.

## Motivation
The Rust ecosystem comes with a lot of third-party web server crates.
A lot of crates are absolutely brilliant, but none of them really clicked with me.

This is the reason I started Webby. I want to write an easy-to-use yet complete web server that allows users to easily create new servers with Rust.
One of the main issues I have with existing frameworks is that it's either too low-level, or not as user-friendly as I'd like.
